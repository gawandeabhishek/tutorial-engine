Project layout (high level)

- `src/app` — Next.js app routes and pages
- `src/components` — UI and AI elements (see `components/` for categories)
- `src/tutorial` — tutorial flow loader and store
- `src/lib/ai` — embedding helpers and AI utilities
- `src/app/api/chat/route.ts` — server route that streams model responses and uses the search service

Useful dev notes

- Ingestion: run `ingestFlowFiles()` (server action) to generate audio and insert flows into the local search service. See `src/lib/actions/ingestFlows.ts`.
- Audio files generated by ingestion are written to `public/tutorials/<tour>/<step>.mp3`.
